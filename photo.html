                Kelly winston is a young, energetic and talented  fashion photographer who focuses on capturing 
                the beauty in every human being. Her works draw inspiration from the diversity in the day to day
                life of people, and she views the world differently through her lenses-she's expecially fond of
                sigma lenses. Her photographs are vibrant yet classy, formal but fun in a way that appeals to both
                the older and the younger generation. She is well known for transforming what may seem ordinary into 
                a fusion of realistic art and fictional fairytale.
              </p>

              <p>
                Kelly acquired her love for photography at a tender age, when she would accompany her father to art 
                galleries and photoshoots. She eventually purchased her first ever camera, by working her ass off at a 
                summer job and this led to the beginning of her career. She has been opportuned to work with some A-list 
                celebrities, and has been involved in many collaborations. She is a very talented photographer so watch as 
                her name continues to cause a ripple in both the local and global industry.
             </p>
             <p>
                While in HONG-KONG, she was employed in the XINSIA gallery where the chief executive officer of the company
                Clarisse Wong noticed her potential and passion for photography and decided to mentor her and teach her the 
                do's and don't's of photography. She also helped her curate and launch her first ever photography exhibition.
                Kelly continued in her quest to be a successful fashion photographer and little by little she started
                to climb the ladder of success. Her first big break was when she was contracted to be the in house photographer
                for Oprah Winfrey during her show. Her name started making waves and she started to gather the recognition that she deserved.
             </p>

             <p>
                Now her works are sold all over the world. Her most recent work was auctioned at Dubai to be displayed at the 
                museum of illusions. Having made a name for herself, Kelly spends her free time vacationing in the carribean, when she 
                is not teaching classes at her photography school. Her story is one that inspires resilence and hardwork.
